# nimbuschat

This repository currently provides a simple demo for user signup and login
using AWS Amplify. Real-time chat functionality has not been implemented yet.

## Demo

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser. You can double-click the file or
   drag it into a browser window.
2. Use the **Signup** form to create a new account.
3. Confirm the signup via email if required, then return to `index.html` and
   use the **Login** form to sign in.

That's all there is for nowâ€”chat features are coming in the future.
